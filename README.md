將 YouTube 影片分段，可直接點選跳到任意段落。比如可以任意唱副歌多次，或隨時跳回前奏或間奏。這是為教會敬拜所設計的工具，支援雙螢幕顯示。[示範網頁](https://christorng.github.io/SongsAlive/src/)

Live remix YouTube song's sections. Designed for church worship service. [Live demo](https://christorng.github.io/SongsAlive/src/).

You need dual screen to show the full screen player on the projecting screen.

Currently new songs needs to be added by me. Add [Issues](https://github.com/ChrisTorng/SongsAlive/issues) to notify me.

Welcome any contribution, including coding, layout and new songs.

# Future plan

* Replace JavaScript with TypeScript
* Play any video/audio
* Play audio with images/PowerPoint
* For group meeting worship, worship leader controlls the playing, while others watching from their phone synchronously
