# [SongsAlive](https://christorng.github.io/SongsAlive/src/)
Live remix YouTube song's sections. Designed for church worship service. [See it live](https://christorng.github.io/SongsAlive/src/).

You need dual screen to show the full screen player on the projecting screen.

Currently new songs needs to be added by me. Add [Issues](https://github.com/ChrisTorng/SongsAlive/issues) to notify me.

Welcome any contribution, including coding, layout and new songs.

# Future plan

* Rewrite by [F#](https://fsharp.org/) with [SAFE stack](https://safe-stack.github.io/)
* Play any video/audio
* Play audio with images/PowerPoint
* For group meeting worship, worship leader controlls the playing, while others watching from their phone synchronously
